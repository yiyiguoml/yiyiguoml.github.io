Greetings! I am currently a PhD candidate at the Trustworthy Machine Learning and Reasoning Group, School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne, advised by Dr. Feng Liu.

My research focuses on **deep learning-based bias correction for weather forecasting**, aiming to improve forecast reliability through robust and intelligent learning algorithms. The project involves addressing systematic errors in long-range prediction models by developing data-driven correction frameworks â€” a timely and impactful direction in the context of climate change and growing interest in trustworthy AI.

I received my undergraduate degree from **McGill University**, and I'm now proud to continue my journey in research and discovery here in Melbourne.


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
